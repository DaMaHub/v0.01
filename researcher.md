## What is Data Management Hub for Researchers

We asked researchers what they NEED for day to day data management and what they WANT from it.

The researchers need a DISTRIBUTED data management solution which fits into their WORKFLOWs, 
enables SECURE COLLABORATION on sensitive data and empower dissemination of research outcomes in the way that data remain USEFUL for decades. 

They need the solution which AUTHENTICATEs and TIMESTAMPs generated research data on the background and enables scientists to benefit from state of art VERSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM in order empower REPLICATIONs of scientific studies UNIVERSALLY.

The solution needs to be OPEN SOURCE, so there is NO VENDOR LOCKIN. It has to incorporate DATA PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGY like LOCKSS.

Researchers want to see their CAREERS BENEFITING from PEER REVIEWING of work of their collegues. They want DATA AUTHORSHIP to be attributed to them, so they get ACADEMIC CREDIT for investing time in data management.

For a researcher  Data Management Hub is, at first sight, just another directory on the local computer. You can save files in it, and  DaMaHub takes care of the versioning in the background. Sharing access is as easy as sending an email. The system will prompt the user for additional metadata to help the collaborator to get started with the data. If required, the complete power of a state-of-the-art versioning system is available to researchers, making it easy to manage different versions and follow up changes or detect differences.
 
With  Data Management Hub it will also be easy to open up the research data, which will only require a few clicks. The decentralised network, based on a distributed file system (IPFS) and blockchain technology, will take care of Open Data publishing, archiving and interaction with data on a worldwide scale. Social sharing, peer reviewing and re-use of open research data will be built into this system.
 
We already have a basic demonstration of the technology https://github.com/kubrik-engineering/opendocumentrepository

Data Management Hub has the potential to be as transformative for scientific work as Github has been for programming and will generate a similar level of interaction with open research data.
